## Problem 2

### Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
# importing mr. trash dataset

mt_df = readxl::read_excel("trash_wheel_data_updated.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N587") 
```

``` r
# cleaning up the dataset

  janitor::clean_names(mt_df) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster)|> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    vessel_name = "mr trash")
```

``` r
# updating the homes_powered variable

mt_df = 
  mutate(mt_df, homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

### Professor Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
# importing professor trash dataset

pt_df = readxl::read_excel("trash_wheel_data_updated.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M109")
```

``` r
# cleaning up the dataset

pt_df =
  janitor::clean_names(pt_df)|>

  mutate(vessel_name = "prof trash")
```

``` r
# updating the homes_powered variable

pt_df = mutate(pt_df, homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

### Gwynnda Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
# importing gwynnda trash dataset

gt_df = readxl::read_excel("trash_wheel_data_updated.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L159")
```

``` r
# cleaning up the dataset

  mutate(vessel_name = "gwyn trash") 
```

``` r
# updating the homes_powered variable

gt_df = mutate(gt_df, homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

### Combined

``` r
# creating a new data frame that combines all the data sets

trash_df = bind_rows(mt_df, pt_df, gt_df)
```

### Summary

Mr. Trash Wheel (`mt_df`), Professor Trash Wheel (`pt_df`), and Gwynnda
Trash Wheel (`gt_df`) are water vessels that remove trash from the Jones
Falls river in Baltimore, Maryland and dumps them into a dumpster site.
The data sets `mt_df`, `pt_df`, and `gt_df` include information about
the dumpster number, date of collection, amount of total litter, and the
specific litter type. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel was 216.26 tons. The total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda Trash Wheel was 1.63^{4} tons. In the combined data
set of all three trash vessels (`trash_df`), there are 845 observations
with an average litter weight of 3.01 tons and information collected
from 2014 to 2023. Notably, the sports balls variable had 261 missing
values.

## Problem 3

### Baseline Demographics

``` r
# importing the data set

baseline_df = read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1, col_names = TRUE)
```

``` r
# cleaning the data set

    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
    ),
    apoe4 = case_match(
      apoe4,
      1 ~ "carrier",
      0 ~ "non-carrier"
    )) 

baseline_df_tidy =

  mutate( age_at_onset = as.numeric(age_at_onset)
  ) |> 
  drop_na(age_at_onset)

### Summary

The dataset (`baseline_df`) describes basic demographic information of
participants in the study. The study aimed to understand the trajectory
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers by monitoring the development of
Mild Cognitive Impairement (MCI). The initial dataset contains
information about the variables in the first row thus when importing the
data, it had to be indicated that the first row should be skipped.
Overall, 483 participants were recruited and 97 developed MCI. The
average baseline age was 70 years old with 13.0434783 percent of women
in the study being a apoe4 carrier, the gene associated with a higher
risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

### Biomarker Values

``` r
# importing the data set

amyloid_df = read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1, col_names = TRUE)
```

``` r
# cleaning the data set

amyloid_df =
  janitor::clean_names(amyloid_df)
